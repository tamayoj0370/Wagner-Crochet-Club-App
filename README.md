# Project Name: WHS Crochet CLub sign up App
For this project I decided to focus on a simple webb app thats allows to help students sign up for the Wagner Crochet Club easily without the hassle of keeping track of paper forms and then manually signing them up individualy. While I linked the web app data to a google sheet creating a reliable and faster way to keep count of new members. 

## The problem
Especially at school clubs use papers sign up sheets but its not the best way since they often get lost or simply mishandled leading the information to become disorganized. Also students often dont have the best handwriting creating a problem of trying to guess their names which is not always easy. Lastly students are forgetful and teachers cant always keep up which leads the students to enter the same information again. 

## The solution 
My app provides a single online sign up page where students can enter their information:

- Name
- Student ID
- Grade

This information gets saved automatically to a google sheet which is accesible to the teachers who sponsor this club. Allowing easy acess.

## Who is this app for
This app is intended for students who want to join the Wagner High School Crochet Club. Also it helps the club leaders like myself to be well organized. 

## How does the App work
1. The student fills out the sign up form on the website
2. The app sends the data to a Google Apps Script web app then
3. The data is saved to a Google Sheet
4. The website fetches the saved data (It should display the members current members - still in progress)

# The following Tools that I used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Google Apps Script
- Google Sheets (data storage)
- GitHub Pages (website hosting)
- Canva (mockup)
- Youtube for tips on the project

## What I learned 
- Just recently I learned that you can acess App scripts through google sheets
- How to use github pages to create a live website
- How to use AI for the foundation of the code also errors
- Its really cool how the code can connect multiple data and how they can communicate with one another.
- Also I learned how Github can be used to help you make your project come to life.
